### **Time To Prepare Before Workout**

If you need a few seconds between pressing the **Start** button and actually
beginning the workout, move the scroll wheel to the desired number of seconds.

The "Play 5 second countdown at start of each phase", if activated, will count
down before the workout starts regardless of the configuration of this setting.
