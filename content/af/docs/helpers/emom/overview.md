**EMOM** stands for "**Every Minute On the Minute**." It is a type of interval training structure used in workouts where a specific task or set of exercises must be completed at the start of every minute. Once the work is completed, the athlete rests for the remainder of that minute before starting again at the top of the next minute.

### **How EMOM Works**

**Start of the Minute**: At the beginning of each minute, you perform a predetermined number of reps or a specific task.

**Rest Period**: After completing the work, the remaining time in that minute is your rest period.

**Repeat**: The process repeats at the start of every subsequent minute for a set duration (e.g., 10 minutes, 20 minutes, etc.).

### **Example of an EMOM Workout**

**10-Minute EMOM**:

- Minute 1: 10 kettle bell swings
- Minute 2: 5 pull-ups
- Repeat this pattern for 10 minutes.

Alternatively:

**8-Minute EMOM**:

- Every minute, complete 12 wall balls and 8 push-ups. Rest for the remainder of the minute.

### **Benefits of EMOM Workouts**

**Pacing and Consistency**: EMOMs help athletes practice pacing by encouraging consistent performance across all intervals.

**Built-In Rest**: The rest period ensures recovery, allowing athletes to maintain intensity over longer durations.

**Scalability**: EMOMs can be scaled to suit different fitness levels by adjusting reps, weights, or complexity of movements.

**Time Efficiency**: EMOMs are structured and timed, making them a great way to fit a challenging workout into a limited time.

### **Key Considerations**

**Work-to-Rest Ratio**: If the work takes too long (e.g., more than 45 seconds), there wonâ€™t be enough rest, which can compromise performance in later rounds. Proper scaling is crucial.

**Task Complexity**: EMOMs can involve one exercise, multiple exercises, or even a mix of strength and conditioning movements.

### **Final Thoughts**

EMOMs are a versatile tool in fitness programming and can be adapted for strength, endurance, skill development, or metabolic conditioning.
