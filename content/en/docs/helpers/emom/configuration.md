### **EMOM Duration**

Move the scroll wheels to select the desired duration of one set of EMOM.

The wheels are arranged in the familiar **hours : minutes : seconds** format.

### **Time To Prepare Before Workout**

If you need a few seconds between pressing the **Start** button and actually
beginning the workout, move the scroll wheel to the desired number of seconds.

The "Play 5 second countdown at start of each phase", if activated, will count
down before the workout starts regardless of the configuration of this setting.

### **Number of Additional Sets**

Move the scroll wheel to select the desired number of **additional** EMOM 
sets.

If the scroll wheel is at 0, you will have exactly one EMOM set.

Here you can configure what type of sound prompts you want, to help you with
executing your workout without having to look at the screen the whole time.

All sound prompts are optional.

**Play sound at end of preparation time**

This sound will tell you to move your behind because the workout is starting.

**Play sound at end of set**

Here you can configure what type of voice prompts you want, to help you with
executing your workout without having to look at the screen the whole time.

This voice prompt will tell you that there are ten seconds left before the end
of the current activity (workout or rest) and the start of the next activity

This voice prompt will count down from 5-4-3-2-1 and beep at 0, starting at 5
seconds before the start os the next activity (workout or rest).

the workout, regardless of the "Time To Prepare Before Workout" setting.

This voice prompt will announce "Well done!" at the very end of the workout.
