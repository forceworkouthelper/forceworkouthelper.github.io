A "**Descending**" workout decreases work interval durations while often increasing rest periods.

This structure helps maintain intensity as fatigue accumulates.

### **Example Workout**

Round 1: 60 seconds work (e.g., burpees) / 10 seconds rest

Round 2: 45 seconds work / 20 seconds rest

Round 3: 30 seconds work / 30 seconds rest

Shorter bursts allow maximum effort despite mounting fatigue.

### **Benefits**

- Prioritizes technique and power output as rest increases.
- Reduces injury risk by shortening strain periods over time.
- Ideal for "finisher" routines to exhaust remaining energy.

### **Use Cases**

- Strength training circuits with compound movements.
- Sprint intervals where form preservation is critical.

### **Key Considerations**

Escalating suits athletes building workload tolerance.

Descending aids in managing fatigue while sustaining effort.

Both can adapt rest/work ratios (e.g., static rest with escalating work).

### **Final Thoughts**

By tailoring these timers to fitness goals, users can optimize progress, whether aiming for endurance gains or explosive power retention.
