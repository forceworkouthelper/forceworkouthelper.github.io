Click the **Timer** tab of the Interval Training timer.

{{% timer_buttons_start_stop %}}

{{% timer_buttons_skip %}}

For example, if you have a rest period of 60 seconds and you want to start the
next exercise after only 30 seconds of rest, click the **Rest** button. That will
terminate the rest period and start the next exercise.
