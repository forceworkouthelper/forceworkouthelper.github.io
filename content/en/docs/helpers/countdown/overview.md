A countdown timer is a tool or device that measures and displays the remaining time until a specific event or deadline occurs. It starts from a set amount of time and counts down to zero in seconds.

### How It Works
- **Set Duration**: You input the desired time.
- **Counting Down**: The timer begins at the set value and decreases incrementally until it reaches zero.
- **Alert**: When the timer hits zero, it typically signals the end with a sound, visual cue, or notification.

### Common Uses
1. **Cooking**: To track time for baking or boiling (e.g., a 20-minute timer for cookies).
2. **Productivity**: In techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a break.
3. **Exercise**: To time workouts or rest intervals (e.g., 30 seconds of plank).
4. **Events**: Counting down to a launch, holiday, or special occasion (e.g., New Year’s Eve).
5. **Education**: To manage time during tests or activities.
6. **Games**: To limit turns or rounds in timed challenges.

Countdown timers can be physical (like a kitchen timer) or digital (apps, websites, or built into devices like phones). They’re simple yet versatile, helping people stay on track or build anticipation for something upcoming.
