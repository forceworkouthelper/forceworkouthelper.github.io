### **AMRAP Duration**

Move the scroll wheels to select the desired duration of one round of AMRAP.

The wheels are arranged in the familiar **hours : minutes : seconds** format.

### **Time To Prepare Before Workout**

If you need a few seconds between pressing the **Start** button and actually
beginning the workout, move the scroll wheel to the desired number of seconds.

The "Play 5 second countdown at start of each phase", if activated, will count
down before the workout starts regardless of the configuration of this setting.

### **Number of Additional AMRAPs**

Move the scroll wheel to select the desired number of **additional** AMRAP 
rounds.

If the scroll wheel is at 0, you will have exactly one AMRAP round.

### **Rest Between AMRAPs**

Move the scroll wheel to select the desired number of seconds of rest between
AMRAP rounds.

If the scroll wheel is at 0, the one AMRAP round will start immediately after
the end of the preceding round.
