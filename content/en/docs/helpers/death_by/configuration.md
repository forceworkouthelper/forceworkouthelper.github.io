### **Set Round Duration**

Move the scroll wheels to select the desired duration for a round (typically 
1 minute).

The wheels are arranged in the familiar **hours : minutes : seconds** format.

If set to zeroes, the round duration will be unlimited.

### **Time To Prepare Before Workout**

If you need a few seconds between pressing the **Start** button and actually
beginning the workout, move the scroll wheel to the desired number of seconds.

The "Play 5 second countdown at start of each phase", if activated, will count
down before the workout starts regardless of the configuration of this setting.

### **Sound Cues**

Here you can configure what type of sound prompts you want, to help you with
executing your workout without having to look at the screen the whole time.

All sound prompts are optional.

**Play sound at end of preparation time**

This sound will tell you to move your behind because the workout is starting.

**Play sound at end of round**

This sound will tell you that the workout phase is done and you can rest before
the next workout phase.

### **Voice Cues**

Here you can configure what type of voice prompts you want, to help you with
executing your workout without having to look at the screen the whole time.

All voice prompts are optional.

**Play 10 second warning at start of each phase**

This voice prompt will tell you that there are ten seconds left before the end
of the current activity (workout or rest) and the start of the next activity
(workout or rest).

**Play 5 second countdown at start of each phase**

This voice prompt will count down from 5-4-3-2-1 and beep at 0, starting at 5
seconds before the start os the next activity (workout or rest).

If activated, this voice prompt will also count down at the very beginning of
the workout, regardless of the "Time To Prepare Before Workout" setting.

**Play voice at start of round**

This voice prompt will announce "Go!" at the start of each workout set.
