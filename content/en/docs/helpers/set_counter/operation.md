Click the **Timer** tab of the Set Counter.

### **Starting, Pausing, Resuming, and Stopping The Rest Timer**

Click the **Start** button to start the rest timer.

At any time you can click the **Pause** button to pause the timer, which will
then change to **Resume** that you can click to continue the timer.

Click the **Stop** button to end the timer.

### **Skipping Phases**

At any time during the workout, you can skip the rest time by clicking
the **Skip** button directly below the time display.

### **Select Desired Number of Sets**

The scroll wheel next to the set count can be used as a visual cue to
remind you of how many sets you want to do.

It is entirely optional and does not affect the functioning of the helper.

### **Automatically Incrementing The Set Count**

If the rest timer is used, it will automatically increment the set count.

### **Manually Adjusting The Set Count**

Click the **Plus** button to add one to the set count and the **Minus** button 
to subtract one from the set count.

The counter does not go below zero, i.e., it does not do negative numbers.

### **Rest The Set Count**

Click the **Reset** button to set the set count to zero.
