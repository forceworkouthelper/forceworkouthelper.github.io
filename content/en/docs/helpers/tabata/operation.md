Click the **Timer** button of the TABATA timer.

### **Starting, Pausing, Resuming, and Stopping**

Click the **Start** button to start the timer.

At any time you can click the **Pause** button to pause the timer, which will
then change to **Resume** that you can click to continue the timer.

Click the **Stop** button to end the timer.

### **Skipping Phases**

At any time during the workout, you can skip the current activity by clicking
the button directly below the time display.

For example, if you have a rest period of 10 seconds and you want to start the
next round after only 5 seconds of rest, click the **Rest** button. That will
terminate the rest period and start the next round.
