A "**Escalating**" workout increases work interval durations while often decreasing rest periods.

The goal is to build endurance and mental resilience by gradually intensifying the challenge.

### **Example Workout**

Round 1: 20 seconds work (e.g., sprinting) / 20 seconds rest

Round 2: 30 seconds work / 15 seconds rest

Round 3: 40 seconds work / 10 seconds rest

Total time per round increases, demanding greater stamina.

### **Benefits**

- Enhances aerobic and anaerobic capacity.
- Mimics real-life scenarios where effort peaks over time (e.g., sports finals).
- Encourages pacing strategy early on to conserve energy for longer intervals.

### **Use Cases**

- Endurance training for runners or cyclists.
- HIIT workouts focusing on progressive overload.

### **Final Thoughts**

These workouts focus on building endurance and gradually increasing intensity.
