## What is it?

The Force Workout Helper is designed to help you accomplish your fitness goals.
It offers many different timers that keep you true to your intended workout schedule.

## Why do I want it?

- **What is it good for?**: It excels in keeping time for various types of workout 
  routines, from AMRAP to EMOM, from set counter to TABATA, and others. Each timer 
  is configured individually, including the voice and sound cues for the timer.

- **What is it not good for?**: It does not recommend different workouts or exercises.
  It is purely a time keeper par excellence.

- **What is it _not yet_ good for?**: It does not yet retain history of your workout times,
  but that is on the roadmap of the product.

## What does Ferox Constantia mean?

The phrase **"ferox constantia"** combines Latin roots:  

- **"Ferox"** means "fierce," "wild," or "untamed."  
- **"Constantia"** translates to "consistency," "steadfastness," or "perseverance."  

Together, it means **"fierce consistency"** or **"unwavering resolve"**, suggesting a relentless and determined spirit in the face of challenges. The combination evokes themes of resilience, loyalty, or indomitable will.

That is how we get results that matter.
